# WebGoggles
Interactive Inspect element, condensed in a JavaScript bookmarklet. (Stolen from Mozilla)

## Why?
Only reason this repository exists is because I found it surprisingly hard to get the code for this. (More accessible for me and *possibly* you)

## How?
*1.* Go to bookmarklet.js or use this [link](bookmarklet.js) <br>
*2.* Press the "Raw" button to view the code on a seperate page.<br>
*3.* Copy the script on the page. <br>
*4.* Create a new bookmark titled whaatever you want, and paste the script as the url. <br>
*5.* Go to a site you would like to edit and click on the bookmark. <br><br>
> [!NOTE]
> Some sites block and affect how bookmarklets work, sometimes causing it to not work.
<br>
You are now able to edit the html of anything on the page by clicking it <br>

<center>The rest is self-explanatory, have fun!</center>
