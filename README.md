# WebGoggles
Interactive Inspect element, condensed in a JavaScript bookmarklet. (Stolen from Mozilla)

## Why?
Only reason this repository exists is because I found it surprisingly hard to get the code for this. (More accessible for me and *possibly* you)

## How?
*1.* Go to bookmarklet.js or use this [link](google.com)
*2.* Press the "Raw" button to view the code on a seperate page.
